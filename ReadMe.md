This is a prototype e-commerce website made by Tele Caster Nilsen.
Created during my first year at Noroff School of Technology and Media.

## Description

Gamehub is an online community and store for games, where the audience can buy games, and create users and login to sell their own. _NOTE!_ At the moment, user creation is not up and running yet, so login will only be a simulation. Profile page remains to be created.

Nothing you do at the webpage will have a real-life effect. Meaning that you can go through the events of purchase, without the purchase actually going through.

**Key features:**

- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3

## Built With

Programming languages and tech stack:

- HTML, CSS and Javascript
- node.js

For big projects you will usually have a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` and link to it, but for smaller projects you can simply include instructions here. These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.
