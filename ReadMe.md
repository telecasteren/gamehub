_ABOUT GAMEHUB_

This is a prototype e-commerce website made by Tele Caster Nilsen.
Created during my first year at Noroff School of Technology and Media.

Nothing you do here will have a real effect.
That means that you can go through the events of purchase, without the purchase actually going through.
